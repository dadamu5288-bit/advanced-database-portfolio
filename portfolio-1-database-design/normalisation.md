# Normalisation Explanation - TrustLink Microfinance Bank (simulated)

## 1. Starting point: one messy table

Imagine the bank first stored everything in a single table:

| txn_id | customer_name | customer_phones | account_number | account_type | branch_name | branch_city | amount |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Ada Obi | 0801111111, 0802222222 | 1000000001 | Savings | Wuse Branch | Abuja | 10000 |
| 2 | Ada Obi | 0801111111, 0802222222 | 1000000001 | Savings | Wuse Branch | Abuja | 5000 |

Problems: Ada's details are repeated on every row, changing her phone number means editing many rows, and one cell holds two phone numbers.

## 2. First Normal Form (1NF)

Rule: every cell holds one value, and there are no repeating groups.

`customer_phones` holds two numbers in one cell, which breaks 1NF. In my design, each customer has one `phone` value, so every cell holds a single value.

## 3. Second Normal Form (2NF)

Rule: it must be in 1NF, and every non-key column must depend on the whole primary key, not just part of it.

Customer details (name, phone) depend on the customer, not on the transaction. So I moved them into a separate `customers` table. Account details (account number, balance, status) moved to `accounts`. Each transaction now only stores `account_id` and its own facts (type, amount, time, reference).

## 4. Third Normal Form (3NF)

Rule: it must be in 2NF, and no non-key column should depend on another non-key column.

`branch_city` depends on `branch_name`, not on the customer. So branches live in their own `branches` table, and `customers` only stores `branch_id`. In the same way, `min_balance` and `interest_rate` depend on the account type, so they live in `account_types`.

## 5. How my final tables follow these rules

| Table | Primary key | Foreign keys | What it stores |
|---|---|---|---|
| branches | branch_id | none | Branch name and city |
| customers | customer_id | branch_id | Personal details |
| account_types | type_id | none | Type name, minimum balance, interest rate |
| accounts | account_id | customer_id, type_id | Account number, balance, status |
| transactions | txn_id | account_id | Each deposit, withdrawal or transfer leg |
| transfers | transfer_id | from_account, to_account | Transfer requests and their status |

Each fact is stored in one place only, so updating it once updates it everywhere.

## 6. One deliberate exception

`accounts.balance` could be calculated by adding up all of an account's transactions, so storing it is technically redundant. I store it on purpose because reading one value is much faster than summing a very large ledger every time. To keep it trustworthy, I will check it with an audit query that compares each balance to the sum of its transactions.

## 7. Keys and constraints (summary)

- Primary keys give every row a unique ID.
- Foreign keys stop a record pointing at something that doesn't exist (for example, an account for a customer who isn't in the database).
- `NOT NULL` makes sure important fields are filled in.
- `UNIQUE` on email, account number and transaction reference prevents duplicates.
- `CHECK` rules block bad data: no negative balances, no zero or negative amounts, only valid statuses and transaction types, and no transfer from an account to itself.
