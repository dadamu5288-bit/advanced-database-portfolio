# Portfolio 4 - NoSQL and Advanced Data Models

Case study: TrustLink Microfinance Bank (simulated)
Database: MongoDB Community Server, database `bankdb\_nosql` (document model)

## Files

## How to run

1. Install MongoDB Community Server and MongoDB Compass.
2. In Compass, connect to `mongodb://localhost:27017`, then open the MongoDB shell from the connection.
3. Paste the numbered sections of `mongo\_demo.js` into the shell one at a time.

## Why MongoDB for this part of the bank

In MongoDB I stored the customer profiles and the transaction logs of the TrustLink bank. I chose MongoDB for these because their structure changes from record to record. A profile holds KYC details, devices and alert preferences that differ between customers, and each log has different fields depending on the channel: ATM logs have an atm field, POS logs have a pos field, and branch deposits have a branch field. In PostgreSQL this would need many empty columns or several extra tables. I kept balances, transfers and the ledger in PostgreSQL because money needs strict rules such as ACID transactions, foreign keys and CHECK constraints, which Portfolio 3 showed. When I flagged the ATM-310 withdrawal, I added the flagged and flag\_reason fields to that one document without changing any other document, which would have meant altering the whole table in SQL.

## A challenge I faced

When I started Portfolio 4, the MongoDB download page did not show the Windows version, so I had to change the platform and package options and download the Windows installer. After installing, Compass opened on a welcome screen and I could not find the shell, because it was not at the bottom of the window as I expected. I found it by opening the shell from the connection's menu, and I checked it worked by running db.version(). After inserting the data, the new database did not appear in the sidebar because there was no refresh button, so I confirmed the inserts from the shell by counting the documents and listing the collections. I learned that a database tool can look different between versions, and that I can check my work from the command line when the interface does not update.
